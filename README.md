### `Product Reviews Classifier` ###

This repository contains work developed in the Natural Language masters course @ IST. It consists of a LR model that extracts hand-crafted features from product reviews to classify them into one of 5 classes.

To run our program, run the `reviews.py` script inside the `SUBMISSION` directory, specifying a path for the train and test sets. For example:
```shell
python reviews.py -test ../test.txt -train ../train.txt
```

Final grade: 20/20.
